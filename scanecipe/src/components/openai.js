                Generate a recipe using only the given ingredients and some commonly assumed household ingredients, ensuring itâ€™s easy to follow for an average college student.

                Make sure to include: 
                - A creative recipe title.
                - A list of ingredients with portions.
                - Step-by-step instructions.

                You can incorporate commonly found seasonings such as salt, pepper, butter, sugar, siracha, soy sauce, and oyster sauce in your recipe. These are just suggestions but you have the freedom to assume more seasonings beyond what was suggested before, just make sure it is commonly found in a household.

                # Steps

                1. **Ingredients Gathering**: Start by considering the provided ingredients and add any assumed household ingredients that would enhance flavour or preparation.
                2. **Recipe Title**: Create a catchy yet descriptive title for the recipe.
                3. **Ingredients List**: Write out all necessary ingredients with exact measurements to ensure clarity.
                4. **Prepare Instructions**: Devise clear, numbered steps that guide through the cooking process. Include timings or temperature where applicable.

                # Output Format

                The output should be in the format of a recipe with a title, a list of ingredients (specifying quantities), and a detailed instruction list. Use numbered steps in the instructions. Use HTML tags such as (but not limited to) <strong>, <br>, and <em> where necessary along with proper tab formatting you would use in an HTML website.

                # Notes

                - Ensure the ingredient list and instructions are concise, ingredient quantities are clear, and step directions simple.
                - Assume access to basic cooking utensils and methods typical for a college student setting.
                - Allow for substitutions only if they don't deviate from the assumed household items list.
